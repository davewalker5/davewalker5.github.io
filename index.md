# Welcome to Sightings Hub

Welcome to my collection of wildlife and aircraft reports, created from my own personal sightings and records.

All of these records are captured using one of the following applications:

- [**Nature Recorder**](https://github.com/davewalker5/NatureRecorderPy)
- [**Flight Recorder**](https://github.com/davewalker5/FlightRecorder)
- [**Raspberry Pi Weather Station**](https://github.com/davewalker5/RPi-WeatherStation)

The ADS-B tracking application can also be used for live aircraft tracking:

- [**ADS-B BaseStation Reader**](https://github.com/davewalker5/ADS-B-BaseStationReader)

If you’d like to keep track of your own observations, you’re very welcome to explore the apps and use these applications for your own recordings.
